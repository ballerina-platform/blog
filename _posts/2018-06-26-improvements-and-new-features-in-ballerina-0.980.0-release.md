Ballerina 0.980.0 release included some type system improvements and new features. This release also focused on stabilizing the platform with lot of bug fixes and improvements.

## Object Syntax Change

Object type descriptor syntax now supports visibility modifiers for both object fields and functions. There are three types of access modifiers (public, private, no-modifier) as explained below.

```ballerina

public type Person object {
    // public - visible everywhere
    public string name;

    // private - visible only within object and its member functions
    private int age;

    // no-modifier - visible only within same package
    string email;
};
```


## Closed and Open Records

An `open` record can contain extra fields, that is, fields other than those named by individual type descriptors in the record type definition. By default, records can contain extra fields with `any` value without any changes to record definition as explained below.

```ballerina

type Person record {
    string name,
    int age = 10,
};

...
// The "country" is an extra field, which is not defined in the person
// type descriptor.
Person tom = { name : "tom", age : 20, country : "USA"};

// You can access the "country" field similar to other fields, but the
// return type will be `any`.
any country = tom.country;

```

Additional fields can be defined by using an optional `RecordRestType...` at the end of the record definition. In the above example, the Person record definition is equivalent to the definition with `any...`.

```ballerina

type Person record {
    string name,
    int age = 10,
    any...
};

```

The “rest fields” can also be constrained to other types. Below example shows how it is constrained to `string` type.

```ballerina

type Person record {
    string name,
    int age = 10,
    string…
};

...

Person tom = { name : "tom", age : 20, country : "USA"};
string country = tom.country;

```

A `closed` record cannot contain any extra fields other than what is defined. A closed record can be defined with `RecordRestType` being `!` as below.

```ballerina

type Person record {
    string name,
    int age = 10,
    !...
};


// Following will result in a compile time error.
Person tom = { name : "tom", age : 20, country : "USA"};

```


## Fixed Length Arrays

The length of an array can be fixed by providing the array length with the array type descriptor.

```ballerina

int[5] array1 = [2, 15, 200, 1500, 5000];

// Following creates an integer array of size five, filled with
// default integer values
int[5] array2;

```

An array length of `!...` means that the length of the array is to be implied from the context; as shown below:

```ballerina

// Following creates a sealed integer array of size 3.
int[!...] sealedArray = [1, 3, 5];

```


## Byte Type

The `byte` type represents the set of 8-bit unsigned integers. The implicit initial value of the `byte` type is `0`. Value space for `byte` is 0-255 both inclusive.

The following is an example of byte definition.

```ballerina

byte c = 23;

```

Along with general byte array type, there is also a special syntax for defining base64 and base16 based array of bytes. With this, `blob` type is removed and replaced by byte array.

```ballerina

byte[] arr1 = [5, 24, 56, 243];
byte[] arr2 = base16 `aeeecdefabcd12345567888822`;
byte[] arr3 = base64 `aGVsbG8gYmFsbGVyaW5hICEhIQ==`;

```

## Bitwise AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^)
Bitwise operations AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^) have been added for `byte` type and `int` type with the following rules.

Both the right-hand-side and left-hand-side of the expression should be of the same type (`byte` or `int`), and the expected type will be also of the same type. If this is not the case, it will result in a compilation error.
An explicit conversion operation should be applied if the type of one side is not the same as the other side.

```ballerina

byte a = 13;
byte b = 45;
byte c = a & b;
byte d = a | b;
byte e = a ^ b;

```

## Table Expression

A table is intended to be similar to a relational database table. A table value contains an immutable set of column names and a set of data rows. Syntax for defining a table and adding data rows is as below.

```ballerina

table<Person> t1 = table {
	{ primarykey id, primarykey salary, name, age, married }, [
		 {1, 300.5, "jane",  30, true},
		 {2, 302.5, "anne",  23, false},
		 {3, 320.5, "john",  33, true}
	]
};

// We can also create the row records seperately and then use it with
// table definition
Person p1 = { id: 1, age: 30, salary: 300.50, name: "jane", married: true };
Person p2 = { id: 1, age: 30, salary: 300.50, name: "jane", married: true };

table<Person> t1 = table {
	{ primarykey id, salary, name, age, married },
	[p1, p2]
};

```

## Map Access
Values of a map can be accessed using index-based syntax as well as field-access syntax. Accessing a value using field-based syntax returns the value if the key exists. Otherwise a runtime error is thrown. Index-based syntax also will return the value if the key exists. However, it will return a null value if the key does not exist. This would also mean that, for a constrained map, the type of the return value for the index-based syntax is always the `constraint_type|()` as explained below.


```ballerina

map<string> m = {"fname" : "John", "lname" : "Doe"}

// Field based access
string firstName = m.fname;

// Following will result in a runtime error
string middleName = m.mname;

// Index based access
string? firstName = m["fname"];

// Following will return null
string? middleName = m["mname"];

```

## Ballerina Observability
- New API's have been introduced with ballerina observability functionality, such that developers can define their own trace blocks and metrics as explained below.
- Developers can attach the trace information of their code block to the default Ballerina traces, or a new trace as below.

```ballerina

// Create and attach span to the default Ballerina request trace.
int spanId = check observe:startSpan("Child Span");
    // Do Something
_ = observe:finishSpan(spanId);

// Create a completely new trace.
int spanId = observe:startRootSpan("Parent Span");
    //Do Something
int spanId2 = check observe:startSpan("Child Span", parentSpanId = spanId);
    // Do Something
_ = observe:finishSpan(spanId2);
    // Do Something
_ = observe:finishSpan(spanId);

```

- Developers can create a metric (counter or gauge) and have have their own measurements. The created metric can be registered in order to include its measurements to reporters such as Prometheus as below.

```ballerina

// Create counter and register.
map<string> counterTags = { "method": "GET" };
observe:Counter counterWithTags = new ("CounterWithTags",
    desc = "Some description", tags = counterTags);
counterWithTags.register() but {
   error e => log:printError("Cannot register the counter", err = e)
};

// Create statistics config to enable statistics calculation.
observe:StatisticConfig[] statsConfigs = [];
observe:StatisticConfig config =
    {timeWindow:30000, percentiles:[0.33, 0.5, 0.9, 0.99], buckets:3};
statsConfigs[0]=config;

// Create gauge and register.
observe:Gauge gaugeWithStats = new ("GaugeWithTags",
    desc = "Some description", tags = gaugeTags,
    statisticConfig = statsConfigs);

```

- All metrics registered can be retrieved and looked up individually as below.

```ballerina

// Get All Metrics
observe:Metric[] metrics = observe:getAllMetrics();
foreach metric in metrics {
    // Do something.
}

// Look up a registered metric.
map<string> tags = { "method": "GET" };
observe:Counter|observe:Gauge|() metric =
    observe:lookupMetric("MetricName", tags = tags);
match metric {
    observe:Counter counter => {
            counter.increment(amount=10);
    }
    observe:Gauge gauge => {
            gauge.increment(amount = 10.0);
    }
    () => {
           io:println("No Metric Found!");
    }
}

```

## Standard Library Improvements

- With the inclusion of byte[], WebSocket related signatures of resources such as `onBinary`, `onPing`, and `onPong` and functions such as `pushBinary()`, `ping()`, and `pong()` now have `byte[]` in their signature instead of a blob.
- The HTTP transport error handler has been improved so that it recovers execution from inbound/outbound failures such as idle socket timeout and abrupt connection closure.
- The circuit breaker now supports request volume threshold parameter. This parameter sets the minimum number of requests in a `RollingWindow` that will trip the circuit. So the rollingWindow configurations can be specified as below.

```ballerina

rollingWindow : {
      timeWindowMillis: 10000,
      bucketSizeMillis: 2000,
      requestVolumeThreshold: 10
}

```

## Build & Package Management

- The Ballerina `build` command output has been enhanced with more details about the build. Also by default, the test module will now be executed with the `build` command.
- Ballerina `push` command now mandates the Ballerina `build` also along with it, which make sure that packages are built before it is pushed to the Central.
- Ballerina Central now supports to view previous versions of a package. It also now shows Ballerina version compatibility section.

## IDEs & Language Server

- Composer is now shipped as a native Electron App.
- Language server now includes source code formatting and also supports finding all symbols in a document and in the workspace.
- IntelliJ IDEA Ballerina Plugin has added improvements for the Ballerina source code debugger.
