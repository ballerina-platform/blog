We will be moving from Slack to [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/wAJYFbMrG2){:target="_blank"} from Saturday, 1 October, 2022. Our Slack community has grown to over 1,500 users, and we are excited to have them meet our 1000+ users who are currently on Discord! Join the Ballerina server by clicking [here](https://discord.com/invite/wAJYFbMrG2){:target="_blank"}.

We love Slack, but it's not built for large online communities. It lacks moderation features, spam filtering, complete message histories, unlimited file sharing, and more. Which makes sense – after all, Slack was built for corporate teams.

[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/wAJYFbMrG2){:target="_blank"}, on the other hand, was built specifically for large online communities. Many large communities, including development communities like Reactiflux, Python, and Java to name a few have moved. It allows for an unlimited number of users, unlimited file uploads (with a per-file size limit), unlimited message histories, and great moderation and spam filtering features. Discord also includes voice and video chat, which will give our users a more immersive community experience.

The whole idea is to deliver a better experience for our community members, and we feel Discord will deliver just that.

We will continue to keep Slack active in the interim and ensure a smooth migration, but all Ballerina team members and mods will be waiting for you on Discord from Saturday, October 1.

We look forward to seeing you as part of our new community. Click [here](https://discord.com/invite/wAJYFbMrG2){:target="_blank"} to join Ballerina’s Discord server today! 

Cheers, 
The Ballerina Team
