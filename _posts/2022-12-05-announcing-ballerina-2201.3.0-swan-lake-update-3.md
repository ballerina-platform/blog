We are happy to announce a new release, [Ballerina 2201.3.0 (Swan Lake Update 3)](https://ballerina.io/downloads/), the third update release of Ballerina Swan Lake.

The main highlight of this release is the support for generating native executables with GraalVM. This introduces a new `bal build --native` CLI command to generate the GraalVM native executable and the  `bal build --native --cloud=docker` CLI command for the native executable Docker image creation for cloud-enabled projects. For more information, see [Build a native executable](https://ballerina.io/learn/build-a-native-executable/).

The other significant new additions and improvements belonging to multiple areas that are done in this release include the below.

## Compiler updates

- The Swan Lake Update 3 release allows you to use any expression as the default value of a function type parameter.
- There were also a few improvements to working with optional fields.
- An optional terminating semicolon is allowed now for module-level declarations.


## Runtime updates

- Configuration of `nil`, `json`, and array of table values are now supported by configurable variables through the TOML syntax. It is also improved to add filler values when configuring array values.
- The `fromJsonWithType` and `cloneWithType` functions of the `lang.value` module are improved to return the value with the first matching type of the union members when cloning with a union type if multiple matching types are found. Previously those were panicked with ambiguous errors.

 ## Standard Library updates

- Support was added in the `graphql` module for disabling introspection queries, and also for GraphQL interfaces including interfaces implementing interfaces. 
- The `graphql` module is improved with added support for the service-level interceptor execution.
- Additions were done to the `http` module for having a grace period for the graceful stop of the listener. The application will exit when a resource function panics. 
- Now, the HTTP resource functions support defaultable query parameters.
- Server reflection support was added for gRPC services in the `grpc` module and the Protocol Buffers version was updated to 3.21.7.

## Developer tools updates

- The `Run-In-Terminal` feature was introduced to the debugger to accommodate Ballerina programs that take user inputs during the launch mode.
- The GraphQL tool was improved by introducing single client generation for single schema definitions and, enabling the GraphQL client config generation to support runtime configurability.
- Changed the default behavior of the OpenAPI client generation to generate resource methods instead of remote methods.
